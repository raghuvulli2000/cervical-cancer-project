To convert existing working model to tfjs model :-
//After trainining and testing your model
//Note: model is <model name>
1) model.save("model.h5")
2) !pip install tensorflowjs
3) !tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras '/content/model.h5' '/content/model'

After doing this a content folder will be created, and model.json will be generated.
